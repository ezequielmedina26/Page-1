		<td>My story of me facing a eleven foot giant. the description of this behemoth is rock hard 
	dense, and intense just counting the many time I fell, so much that I lost track, 
	every time when I don't succeeding, and when it's my time to go home, I always left 
	disappointed. Now the reason for my challenge against this rock, that in a literal and 
	metaphorical sense it's a huge block thats in my way of going to a better direction, and
	the only way to surpass is to climb over it. Im a person who is to stubborn to avoid 
	a challenge that if i know i could get a good feeling out of it im definitely in for it. </td>
